# IWDSA Club Website

Last summer, IWDSA began to work on a club project in building up our club website. Since the old domain expired and hasn't been 
maintained in forever by its previous web master, we thought that this would be a great opportunity to build our web dev skills by 
building our own site from the ground up. Unfortunately as time went on, we were not satisfied with how the final result turned out and
so the club project was eventually abandoned.

This spring, I came back to this project and tried to re-create the site by myself for some extra practice.
